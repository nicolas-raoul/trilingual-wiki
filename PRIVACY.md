# Privacy Policy for Trilingual Wikipedia

**Effective Date:** July 24, 2025

---

This Privacy Policy describes how Nicolas Raoul ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Trilingual Wiki Android application (the "App").

## 1. No Data Collection

We believe strongly in user privacy. The App is designed to function **without collecting any personally identifiable information (PII) or any other data from you or your device.**

Specifically, the App does **not**:

* Transmit any data to any remote AI API.
* Collect your name, email address, phone number, or other contact details.
* Collect your device ID, advertising ID, IP address, or any unique identifiers.
* Collect your location data.
* Collect information about how you use the App (usage statistics, crash reports initiated by us, etc.).
* Access your contacts, photos, files, or any other personal data stored on your device.
* Use cookies or similar tracking technologies.
* Transmit any data about you or your usage to us or any third party.

Since we collect no information, we do not use, store, secure, or share any user information â€“ because there is none to begin with.

## 2. Permissions

The App may request certain permissions on your Android device to function as intended. These permissions are used solely for the described functionality within the app on your local device and are not used to collect any data.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect information from you through the App.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Since the App collects no personally identifiable information from any users, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions). The App is designed for a general audience.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our associated website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted. The effective date at the top of this policy indicates the latest revision.
